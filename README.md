# ChatGPTKeyWords

  The main purpose of this project is to count the keyword information that people use ChatGPT to query high-frequency questions in their daily work.  
  Projects include frontend, backend and ops. The statistics format of information is consistent with json, which facilitates later 
  maintenance and statistics. 
```json
[
  {
    "type": "your question type",
    "keyword": "your question key words",
    "question": "your question",
    "expected": "is it your expected answer",
    "author": "your name"
  }
]
```
